4) Describe why the top-ranked non-relevant document for each query did not get a lower score.
Ans: Ideally, all the relevant documents should have greater positive scores, and all the non-relevant documents should
have scores below threshold. But in this case, the higher ranked non-relevant documents had very few query terms within
the document which had more weight value. Also, the non-relevant documents did not get low scores due to their higher frequency
within the document. Contrast to this, even the higher-ranked documents are not used in proper manner. The reason is, irrespective 
of its actual meaning, the occurence of term within query and document is considered for relevence calculation. Thus, this cause
the document to become non-relevant.

5) Briefly discuss the different effects you notice with the two weighting schemes,
either on a query-by-query basis or overall, whichever is most illuminating. For
example, you can point out that the weighting scheme seems to be working for
this query as well as a list of other queries, but not for some other queries you
have noticed. Try to explain why it works and why it does not work.
Ans: W1: Uses a form of Maximum Term Frequency
	 W2: Uses a form of OKAPI Term Weighting which is used for Average Document length and Document length
	 
Weighting Scheme - W1: 
It is based on the concept of Maximum Term Frequency. In this, the weights and score are calculated on the basis of the 
frequency of the term which are occuring in the document. The drawback of this weighting scheme is that it only looks for 
term's maximum occurence and not the actual meaning of the query or the document term. This would cause it to include even
the non-relevant documents due the term's occurence irrespective of its meaning.

Weighting Scheme - W2:
It is based on the concept of length of the document. This weighting scheme neither considers the meaning of the query or document
term nor it considers relevence factor.In this, if the term is present in multiple documents, it is given some negative weights and 
this would cause it to include non-relevant documents which might not even has the term.

The weighting scheme W1 is preferred here as it atleast considers the occurence of terms in the query or the document.

6) Describe the design decisions you made in building your ranking system.
The pre-processing of Cranfield documents and Query file is done after removing irrelevant terms, special characters and tags and further lemmatizing
the files.
Weights are calculated for both the Document terms and query terms using both the weighing schemes W1 and W2.
W1 = (0.4 + 0.6 * log (tf + 0.5) / log (maxtf + 1.0)) * (log (collectionsize / df)/ log (collectionsize))
W2 = (0.4 + 0.6 * (tf / (tf + 0.5 + 1.5 * doclen / avgdoclen))) * log (collectionsize / df)/ log (collectionsize))
The weights of each document and query terms are then normalized and later the normalized value of query terms and
document terms are multiplied and then added to get the Cosine Similarity score for a particular (Query(N),Document(ID))
combination.
Thus, the ranking decision in this program is based on the Cosine Similarity score of the (Query(N),Document(ID)) combination.
The program outputs the top 5 ranked documents for every Queries under both the weighting scheme.
The program also outputs the Vector representation of the Query terms as well as the first 5 ranked document terms.
